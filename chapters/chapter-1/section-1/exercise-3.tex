\begin{exercise}
	The following item appeared in a newspaper. ``The expedition used the carbon-14 test to measure the amount of radioactivity still present in the organic material found in the ruins, thereby determining that a town existed there as long ago as $7000$ B.C.'' Using the half-life figure of $\textbf{C}^{14}$ as given in the text, determine the approximate percentage of $\textbf{C}^{14}$ still present in the organic material at the time of the discovery.
\end{exercise}
\begin{remark}
	The text uses a $\textbf{C}^{14}$ half-life of $5600$ years\supercite{ordinary-differential-equations}.
\end{remark}
\begin{solution}
	We begin with the differential equation for exponential decay.
	\begin{equation*}
	\label{equation-ch1-s1-exercise-3}
	\frac{dy}{dt} = -Ky
	\end{equation*}
	Since Equation~\ref{equation-ch1-s1-exercise-3} is a separable linear first-order equation, we divide both sides by $y$ and integrate with respect to $dy$ and $dt$.
	\begin{align*}
	\int \frac{1}{y} \ dy &= \int -K \ dt \\
	\ln \left| y \right| &= -Kt + C \\
	e^{\ln y} &= e^{-Kt + C} \\
	y &= Ce^{-Kt}
	\end{align*}
	Since no carbon-14 has decayed at time $t = 0$, we can assume $C = 1$, and we thus have the general equation for the quantity of carbon-14 with respect to time.
	\begin{equation*}
	y = e^{-Kt}
	\end{equation*}
	Assuming a half-life of $5600$ years, we now solve for the proportionality constant of the rate of decay.
	\begin{align*}
	y\left(t\right) &= e^{-K\left(5600\right)}, \quad \text{for } y\left(t\right) = \frac{1}{2} \\
	\frac{1}{2} &= e^{-5600K} \\
	\ln \frac{1}{2} &= \ln e^{-5600K} \\
	\ln \frac{1}{2} &= -5600K \\
	-\frac{\ln \frac{1}{2}}{5600} &= K
	\end{align*}
	We now use this value for the proportionality constant and a value of $t = 9000$\footnote{Since the town existed during $7000$ B.C., the total elapsed time in years is $7000 + 2000$, assuming a current year of somewhere in the early 2000's.} for our final answer.
	\begin{align*}
	y\left(9000\right) &= e^{-\left(-\frac{\ln \frac{1}{2}}{5600}\right)\left(9000\right)} \\
	&= e^{\frac{9000 \ln \frac{1}{2}}{5600}} \\
	&\approx 0.3282
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, about 32.82\% of the carbon-14 is still present in the organic material 9000 years later.
\end{solution}
